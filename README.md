## IaaS Provider/Subscriber Interaction - Dynamic

**Provider's Resources:** Providers have a pool of VMs to allocate to clients

**Allocation Example:**
- Client A → VM1, VM2
- Client B → VM3
- Client C → VM4, VM5, VM6

## IaaS Component Stack and Scope of Control

IaaS Stack is made up of:

1. **Hardware Layer** - Physical servers and storage
2. **Virtual Machine Monitor** - Hypervisor
3. **Guest OS** - Operating system in VM

### IaaS Cloud Architecture

- **(a) Top level** - User interface and management
- **(b) Middle Level** - Resource orchestration
- **(c) Bottom level** - Physical infrastructure

## Operation of the Cloud Manager

**Cloud Manager** is the interface where subscribers interact with the cloud to:
- Sign up and manage resources
- Access data
- Authenticate users and validate credentials
- Handle top-level resource management and allocation

## Data Object Storage (DOS)

Stores metadata like user credentials, images, etc. It typically has a single instance in the cloud.

**DOS Service** functions similar to cloud storage services.

## Operation of Computer Manager

**Computer Manager** runs on each physical host and interacts with the hypervisor to:
- Create and manage VMs
- Keep track of the number of VMs running
- Monitor resource usage

## Operation of Cluster Manager

**Cluster Manager** oversees a collection of computers connected via high-speed networks.

## Virtualization in IaaS

**Virtualization** allows one physical machine to act as multiple isolated virtual machines, maximizing resource usage.

Includes:
- Virtual memory
- Virtual storage
- Virtual network

## Types of Virtualization

### (a) Full Virtualization

The hypervisor emulates hardware, allowing unmodified guest OSes to run

**Example:** VMware

**Software Based:**
- Makes one computer act like many
- Complete hardware emulation

### (b) Para-Virtualization

The guest OS is modified to interact directly with the hypervisor, improving performance

**Example:** Xen

**Modified Guest:**
- Guest OS is modified to work directly with VM software
- Better performance than full virtualization

### (c) Hardware-Assisted Virtualization

Utilizes processor extensions like Intel VT or AMD-V to improve virtualization

**Unmodified Guest:**
- Uses special hardware to make virtual machines run fast
- Best performance
